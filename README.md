## What's Hackathon?

According to GitHub:

> A hackathon is a sprint-like event in which people collaborate intensively on software projects. The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software or hardware with the goal of creating a functioning product by the end of the event.

In this event, participants must create a working app that:

* Applies to Personal or Business environments
* Must run immediately or run after preparation (must be less than 1m)
* Clear build/installation instruction
* Code should be clear and easy for other developers to read and modify

## Who is eligible to participate in this Hackathon event?

* TheFlightSims official employee
* Maton.NET official employee
* TheFlightSims's mother organization official/unofficial employee

## Community Guidelines

Everyone of the communities are inclusive environments, based on treating
all individuals respectfully, regardless of
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities,
neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race,
age, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or
  physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

Some TheFlightSims open source projects may adopt an explicit project code of
conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants. Most
of those projects will use our modified Contributor Covenant.

## Reporting problems

Some TheFlightSims open source projects may adopt a project-specific code of conduct.
In those cases, a TheFlightSims employee will be identified as the Project Steward,
who will receive and handle reports of code of conduct violations. In the event
that a project hasnâ€™t identified a Project Steward, you can report problems by
emailing to [TheFlightSims](mailto:theflightsims@gmail.com).

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.
We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported
incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from
the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the
report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is
taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the
report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as
ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without
notice.
